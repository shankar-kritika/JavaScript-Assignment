    <h1>This is difference</h1>
    <h2>Var</h2>
    <p >The var statement declares a variable. Variables are containers for storing information. Creating a variable in JavaScript is called "declaring" a variable: var carName; After the declaration, the variable is empty (it has no value).
    </p>
    <h2>Const</h2>
    <p>The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutableâ€”just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned. ... A constant cannot share its name with a function or a variable in the same scope.</p>
    <h2>Let</h2>
    <p>Let allows you to declare variables that are limited to the scope of a block statement, or expression on which it is used, unlike the var keyword, which defines a variable globally, or locally to an entire function regardless of block scope.</p>
