    <h3>JavaScript provides different data types to hold different types of values. There are two types of data types in JavaScript.</h3>
    <p>JavaScript is a dynamic type language, means you don't need to specify type of the variable because it is dynamically used by JavaScript engine. You need to use var here to specify the data type. It can hold any type of values such as numbers, strings etc. For example:

        var a=40;//holding number  
        var b="Rahul";//holding string
        </p>
    <h4>JavaScript primitive data types:</h4>
    <p>There are five types of primitive data types in JavaScript. They are as follows:

        String:	represents sequence of characters e.g. "hello"
        Number:	represents numeric values e.g. 100
        Boolean:	represents boolean value either false or true
        Undefined:	represents undefined value
        Null:	represents null i.e. no value at all</p>
    <h4>JavaScript non-primitive data types:</h4>
    <p>Object:	represents instance through which we can access members
        Array:	represents group of similar values
        RegExp:	represents regular expression</p>
